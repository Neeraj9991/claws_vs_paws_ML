# claws_vs_paws_ML

This repository features a cutting-edge deep learning model trained on extensive datasets of cats and dogs for precise classification.

We are using Streamlit web application that allows users to upload images of cats or dogs, and it uses a pre-trained deep learning model to classify the uploaded image as either a cat or a dog, along with the confidence level of the prediction.

## Features

- Users can upload images in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.
- The application displays the uploaded image along with the prediction values.
- It provides the predicted class (cat or dog) and the confidence level as a percentage.
- Handles errors gracefully and displays informative messages.
